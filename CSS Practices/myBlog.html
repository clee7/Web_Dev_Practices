    <h2>Second Article</h2>
    <p class="first">Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.</p>
    <p>You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! You mean while I'm sleeping in it? And why did 'I' have to take a cab? She also liked to shut up!

    <h2>Only You Could Make Those Words Cute.</h2>
    <p class="first">I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. You're a killer. I catch killers. You're a killer. I catch killers. Keep your mind limber.</p>
    <p>Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. You're a killer. I catch killers. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I have a dark side, too. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask â€¦ not just me.

    Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.

    Watching ice melt. This is fun. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.</p>
